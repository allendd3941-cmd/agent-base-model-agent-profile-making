# Data and Output Policy

This document explains how data and generated outputs should be handled before publishing this repository.

## GIS Data

`GIS data/` contains spatial input data used by the GAMA traffic simulation.

These files are not automatically covered by the repository MIT License. They should be treated as external data assets and remain subject to their original data source licenses.

Before publishing, confirm and document:

- Original data source.
- License or open-data terms.
- Coordinate reference system.
- Preprocessing steps, if any.
- How each layer is used by the GAMA model.

Recommended README note:

```text
The GIS files in `GIS data/` are used as spatial inputs for the GAMA traffic ABM model. Please verify the original data source and license terms before reuse.
```

If the GIS files are from Taiwan government open data sources, document the source URL and attribution requirements, and reference the applicable Open Government Data License where appropriate.

## Generated Outputs

`output/` contains generated local runtime artifacts from LLM calls. These files are useful during experimentation but should not be versioned as source code.

Recommended policy:

- Keep `output/` locally for debugging and analysis.
- Ignore `output/` in Git.
- Copy only selected representative files into `examples/sample_outputs/`.
- Do not commit sensitive prompts, API responses, or local-only runtime logs.

## Portfolio Samples

For portfolio review, curated examples should be small, readable, and representative:

- One agent profile output.
- One perception output.
- One decision-making output.
- One initialization request.
- One step-update request.

This keeps the GitHub repository focused on system design rather than raw experiment logs.

## Repository License Boundary

- Source code, documentation, prompts, and curated examples: MIT License.
- GIS files: original data source license.
- Local generated outputs under `output/`: not versioned.
- Third-party dependencies: each package keeps its own license.
